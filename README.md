# Shopify-Analysis-in-Power-BI

## Project Objective
To design a comprehensive and user-friendly Power BI dashboard that allows Shopify store managers and stakeholders to track sales metrics, understand customer behavior, identify best-selling products, and make informed business decisions based on data.

## Questions(KPIs)

- What is the total sales revenue and profit?
- Which products or categories generate the most revenue?
- How do orders and revenue trend over time (daily/monthly)?
- What is the average order value (AOV)?
- Which customer segments contribute most to revenue?
- What is the order fulfillment status and return rate?
- Which regions or countries have the highest sales?

## Process 
- Data Collection & Import: Imported Shopify datasets (orders, products, customers, returns) into Power BI.
- Data Cleaning & Modeling: Cleaned and structured the data using Power Query (M language).
Created relationships between tables (orders, customers, products, regions)
Created DAX measures for KPIs like Total Sales, Total Orders, Profit Margin, and AOV.
- Dashboard Design: Designed visuals including bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, KPI cards, and maps.
Added slicers for filtering by date, product category, country, and order status.
- Interactivity & UX: Used bookmarks, tooltips, and drill-through pages for a seamless user experience.
Applied consistent theming and layout for professional dashboard appearance.
- Publishing & Sharing: Published to Power BI Service and enabled scheduled refresh (if live dataset is used).
Shared with stakeholders for business use.
